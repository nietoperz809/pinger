Small utility to monitor internet availability

![Pinger Image](pinger.jpg?raw=true "Title")

If you have an unstable internet connection, this little tool might help you.

You will hear a sound when internet becomes available and also when the connection breaks off.

The repository contains a ready-to-run jar executable.

Have fun!
